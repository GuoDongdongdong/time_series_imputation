# Target
For some inevitable reasons, SuoYang earthen ruins datasets have a lot of missing value, We need find a way to achieve accurate missing value imputation, for subsequent forecasting task.

# Progress
## Preprocess the Datasets
Generate uniformly distributed missing value in train, validation and test dataset.

## Model Selection
We select many models such as:
1. Based on statistics: LOCF
2. Based on RNN: BRITS
3. Based on GAN: USGAN
4. Based on Transformer: Transformer, SAITS
5. Based no Diffusion: CSDI

## Experiments

## Improve the Model's Struct

## Comparative experiments and ablation Study
